    # Introduction
    ---
    The Optimal Edge Discovery API is designed to help users discover the most
    optimal edge cloud zones for their applications. This API allows users to
    find the optimal regions and zones for their edge cloud applications.

    ## Features
    - Discover regions and zones to deploy edge cloud applications.

    ## Usage
    Users can utilize this API to enhance the performance and connectivity of
    their applications by selecting the most suitable edge cloud zones and
    application endpoints.

    These APIs may be called either by an application client hosted on a device
    attached to the operator network (i.e. phone, tablet) for following
    scenarios:

    - **Edge Cloud Zone Discovery**:  To find the optimal edge cloud
        zones to deploy application to minimize latency for users in a specific
        region. This can be achieved using the
        `POST /retrieve-optimal-edge-cloud-zones:` API.

    # Identifying the device

    The API returns the closest Edge Cloud Zone to a given device, so that
    device needs to be identifiable by the network. This can be achieved either
    by passing a device identifier in the request header, or, from the 3-legged
    access token where implemented by the operator.

    ## Passing a device identifier in the request header

    * If you call the API from a server, you must explicitly pass one or
    more device identifiers in the HTTP request header:
      * `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`. This is the public IP address of the
      user device: this
      can be obtained by an application hosted on that device calling a
      public IP address API (e.g. GET https://api.ipify.org?format=json)
      * If you provide an `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`: for certain
      operators you may be required to also provide a `Public-port` header.
      * `Phone-Number` . The international E.164 format (starting with country
      code), e.g. +4407123123456
      * `Network-Access-Identifier` (where available from the API host operator)

    * If you call the API from a device attached to the operator network, then
    you can attempt the request without passing device identifier(s) parameters
    in the request header. If that returns a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE`
    error then retry the request but this time include a device identifier.

    NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options.
    The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
    different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the
    same device.

    NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the
    `networkAccessIdentifier` is only part of the schema for future-proofing,
    and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release
    work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need
    to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

      ## Identifying a device from the access token

    This specification defines the `device` identifying headers as optional in
    API requests, specifically in cases where the API is accessed using a
    3-legged access token and the device can be uniquely identified by the
    token. This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers by relying
    on the device information associated with the access token used to invoke
    the API.

    ### Handling of device information:

    #### Optional device identifying headers for 3-legged tokens:

    - When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the access
      token must be considered as the device for the API request. This means
      that a device  identifying header  is not required in the request, and if
      included it must identify the same device, therefore **it is recommended
      NOT to include it in these scenarios** to simplify the API usage and
      avoid additional validations.

    #### Validation mechanism:

    - The server will extract the device identification from the access token,
    if available.
    - If the API request additionally includes a `device`  identifying header
      when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the device
      identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.
    - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a
      403 `INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT` error, indicating that the device information
      in the request does not match the token.

    #### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

    - If the `device`  identifying header is not included in the request and
    the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token,
    nor inferred by the operator if the request is made directly from the
    client, the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

    #### Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated
    identifier:

    - For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier associated to
      the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged access tokens, a
      `device` identifying header MUST be provided in the API request. This
      ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API
      call made with these tokens.

    # Responses

    ## Success

    A JSON object is returned containing an array with a single member object.
    This contains identifiers for the closest Edge Cloud Zone. The HTTP status
    code will be`200 OK`. An example response:

    ```
    [
      {
        "edgeCloudZoneId": "4gt555-6457-7890-d4he-1dc79f44gb66",
        "edgeCloudZoneName": "example zone name",
        "edgeCloudProvider": "example zone provider"
      }
    ]
    ```
    * `edgeCloudZoneId` is a UUID for the Edge Cloud Zone.
    * `edgeCloudZoneName` is the common name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to
    the user device.
    * `edgeCloudProvider` is the name of the operator or cloud provider of
    the Edge Cloud Zone.

    ## Errors

    If the authentication token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is
    returned.

    If the mobile subscription parameters contain a formatting error, a `400
    INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

    If the mobile subscription cannot be identified from the provided
    parameters, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error is returned.

    Any more general service failures will result in an error in the `5xx`range
    with an explanation.

    # Notes for Optimal Edge Discovery API publishers

    If an `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address` header parameter is provided then
    the operator should
    assume the request is coming from a developer's server rather than a device
    attached to the network. In which case the developer server is expected to
    have been provided with the device public IP address (e.g. by the
    application client on that device signalling it back to the server).

    If neither an `IPv4-Address`/`IPv6-Address` parameter, nor any other device
    identifier,  is
    provided in the API request header then the operator should assume the
    request is from a device attached to their network, and attempt to use the
    public IP source address to determine which packet gateway issued it (and
    hence the closest edge to that gateway).

    If no `IPv4-Address`/`IPv6-Address` header parameter is provided, but
    another device identifier(s) is provided, then the operator should assume
    the request is coming from a device attached to their network and should
    make use of one or both of the public IP source address (from the IP packet
    header) and the device identifier(s) provided in the HTTPS request header.

    Should your implementation require the `Port` value to be passed in addition
    to the `IP-Address`, please make that explicit in the documentation, and
    utilise the `GENERIC_400_MISSING_PORT` error if the `Port` header is
    omitted.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a
    client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent
    Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
    onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator
    exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing
    the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework
    dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
    processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
    mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens
    becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict
    compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations,
    upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
