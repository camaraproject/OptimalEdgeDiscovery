# Optimal Edge Discovery API User Story

| **Item** | **Details** |
| ---- | ------- |
| ***Summary*** | As an application developer, I need to discover the most optimal Edge Cloud Zones for deploying my application instances, ensuring my users get the best performance by connecting to edge resources with minimal latency. The Optimal Edge Discovery API allows me to find the Edge Cloud Zones that are closest to a specific device, providing information about their locations, capabilities, and network characteristics. This helps me make informed decisions about where to deploy my application instances to ensure optimal performance for users across different geographical areas. |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** API Consumer:Developer<br> **Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers. Currently the API does not explicitly handle consent management (expects that the API consumer either owns the device subscriptions or has agreed to manage consent as a part of general Terms and Conditions) and hence end users are not included as Actors. As this changes, the actor list will be extended with end users. <br> **Scope:** <ul><li>Discover optimal Edge Cloud Zones for specific devices</li><li>Retrieve information about available Edge Cloud Zones and their capabilities</li><li>Make informed decisions about application deployment locations</li></ul> |
| ***Pre-conditions*** |The preconditions are listed below:<br><ol><li>The API Consumer:BusinessManager and API Consumer:Administrator have been onboarded to the API Exposure Platform.</li><li>The API Consumer:BusinessManager has successfully subscribed to the Optimal Edge Discovery product from the product catalog.</li><li>The API Consumer:Administrator has onboarded the developer:User to the platform.</li><li>The API Consumer either owns the device subscriptions or has agreed to the terms and conditions of the CSP for managing consent of subscription owners.</li><li>The means to get the access token are known to the API Consumer:User to ensure secure access of the API.</li></ol> |
| ***Activities/Steps*** | **Starts when:** <br>1. The API consumer application makes a request to discover the optimal Edge Cloud Zones for a specific device, optionally providing filter parameters to narrow down the results.<br><br>**Ends when:** <br>1. The API endpoint returns information about available Edge Cloud Zones ordered by their proximity to the device. |
| ***Post-conditions*** | 1. The API consumer has information about optimal Edge Cloud Zones for deploying their application instances.<br>2. The API consumer can use this information to make decisions about application deployment or to register application endpoints in these zones. |
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur <br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid input: Not valid input data to invoke operation (e.g. IP address format not as expected).<br>- Invalid filter: The filter parameters provided are not valid or cannot be applied.<br>- Not Found: No Edge Cloud Zones are available that match the specified criteria.<br>- Identifier Not Found: The device identified in the request cannot be found in the network.
